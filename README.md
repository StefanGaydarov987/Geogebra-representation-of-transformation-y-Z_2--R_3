# GeoGebra Representations of Transformation y-Z_2--R_3

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of GeoGebra files that provide visual representations of unique types of 4-tiles. These transformations are from \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) to \( \mathbb{R}_3 \) and offer a comprehensive insight into the geometric interpretations of such mathematical concepts.

## Background
The 4-tiles represented in this collection are directly related to the findings presented in the article "TILINGS WITH NONFLAT SQUARES: A CHARACTERIZATION" by Manuel Friedrich, Manuel Seitz, and Ulisse Stefanelli. Specifically, the representations align with Theorem 2.8, (2.20) within the publication, providing a detailed visual understanding of the theoretical concepts discussed.

## Usage
Each GeoGebra file in this repository corresponds to a unique type of 4-tile. These files are designed to be used with the GeoGebra software, allowing users to interact with and explore the geometric transformations in a dynamic environment.

To use these files:
1. Download and install GeoGebra from [https://www.geogebra.org/](https://www.geogebra.org/).
2. Clone this repository or download the desired GeoGebra files directly.
3. Open the files using GeoGebra to explore the visual representations of the transformations.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. Whether it's adding new 4-tile representations, enhancing the existing files for better clarity, or correcting any inaccuracies, your input is valuable. Please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss your contributions.
